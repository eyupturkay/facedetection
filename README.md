# facedetection
Build event-driven microservices using latest tech, deploy to Azure K8s with CI/CD. Learn message-driven architecture and use Azure Face Detection. Dockerize microservices and gain knowledge of Dapr Side-Car and Azure Cloud. Master microservices deployment in this comprehensive project.

This project will take you through the process of building event-driven microservices applications using the latest dotnet core (NET7) and masstransit technologies, and deploying them to Azure K8s using a CI/CD pipeline.

You'll learn how to design and build microservices that communicate through a message bus, HTTP Rest, and SignalR Core. This project will also cover the message-driven architecture and its application in an image processing app, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the key C# libraries for image processing.

The project will utilize Microsoft Azure's free Face Detection facility to demonstrate the detection and transmission of faces, teaching you how to obtain Face API keys from Azure and integrate them into your code.

You'll explore the conversion of JPEG images to byte arrays for transmission over the message bus and HTTP channel, as well as their storage in database tables in byte array format. You'll also learn how to retrieve original images from byte arrays and convert them back to JPEGs for saving and display.

Finally, you'll learn how to Dockerize your microservices, orchestrate them using docker-compose technology, and deploy them to Azure K8s using a CI/CD pipeline.

Objectives:

Gain knowledge of Dapr Side-Car technology and its support for building microservices
Learn how to provision resources in the Azure Cloud
Create Azure Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files
Develop an Ingress Controller file
Deploy both Dapr and non-Dapr microservices applications to Azure K8s using a CI/CD pipeline.
